# -Codex-Vitae-
This is a my attempt to have a public, accountable self. My goal is to discover how I view the world, and express it as concisely and honestly as possible so that others can let me know when I'm full of shit or missing something.
这是我尝试拥有一个公开、负责任的自我。我的目标是发现我如何看待世界，并尽可能简洁、诚实地表达，以便他人可以告诉我何时我在胡说八道或遗漏了什么。
